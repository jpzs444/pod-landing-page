## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS animations and transitions
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Block Element Modifier (BEM) naming convention
- SCSS
- Parcel

### What I learned

I learned how to apply animations and transitions. I also became more comfortable utilizing SCSS and parcel.

### Continued development

I need to know how to apply animations and transitions to elements that have an absolute position. 

### Useful resources

- [Animista](https://animista.net/) - This website helped me get the exact animations that I want for solving this FEM challenge. I will absolutely use it again for my future projects.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - W3Schools help me get reminded of the fundamentals of HTML and CSS.
